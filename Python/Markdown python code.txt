For the python code alternative movies had to be recommended based on the opinion om the people which reviewed a certain film. I chose to stick with the pirates movie for consistency.
So the challenge was to get the average review for the pirates movie which was a 8.45 and then look for the authos of the reviews and see which other movies they reviewed.
Based on this there are alot of movies which were reviewed by someone who also watched pirates. For this we first made a list of the authos which reviewed pirates.
Then a list of the scores they gave to the other movies they had watched. Then made a list of the unique movies reviewed and then I did not know how to compare all these results in 1 loop so
I did 50 movies which were reviewed by the authors at random to see if some movies are higher rated then pirates and thus are worth a watch.
From the results of the 50 random movies only 1 movie got a higher review and thus is a recommendation which is 'Your name'. Which I have watched and is a great movie in my opinion.
